# Test Driven Development

--> The project consists of the app and tests folders<br />

## Requirements for the app:
--> Ensure that npm is installed<br />
--> `cd app` then run `npm install`<br />
--> start the frontend by running `npm start`<br />

## Requirements for the testing:
--> `cd test` then follow the instructions below<br />
--> `pip install selenium==3.141.0`<br />
--> Download and install Mozilla Firefox<br />
--> Gecko Driver v0.27.0 for Firefox is already in the folder<br />
--> Finally run `python app_tester.py` to execute the Selenium Script<br />
--> View the results in the login_test_logs.txt file
